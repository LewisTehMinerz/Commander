Installing Commander
====================

To install the development version of Commander, enable the Developer Mode
over at chrome://extensions (should be in the top right), clone the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/LewisTehMinerz/Commander>`_,
click "Load Unpacked" and select where you cloned Commander.
This should load it into Chrome.
